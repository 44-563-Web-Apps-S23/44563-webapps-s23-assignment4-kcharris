        <h2>THE FAR-AWAY PRINCESS
            BY
            HERMANN SUDERMANN</h2>
        <h4 class="strubel">STRÜBEL.</h4> <p class="strubel speech">There, ladies! We have now rescued the useful instrument to
        which the far-sightedness of mankind is indebted.</p>

        <h4 class="frau">FRAU V. HALLDORF.</h4>
        <p class="frau speech">Thanks, so much. Pardon me, sir, but have you heard
        anything about the report that the princess is going to make the journey
        up here to-day?</p>

        <h4 class="strubel">STRÜBEL.</h4>
        <p class="strubel speech">The princess? The princess of the Springs? The princess of the
        lonely villa? The princess who is expected at the iron spring every
        morning, but who has never been seen by a living soul? Why, I am
        enormously interested. You wouldn't believe how much interested I am!</p>

        <h4 class="liddy">LIDDY.</h4>
        <p class="direction">[_Who has looked out, back._]</p>
        <p class="liddy speech">There--there--there--it is!</p>

        <h4 class="frau">FRAU V. HALLDORF.</h4>
        <p class="frau speech">The carriage?</p>

        <h4 class="liddy">LIDDY.</h4>
        <p class="liddy speech">It's reached the top already. It is stopping over there at the
        edge of the woods.</p>

        <h4 class="frau">FRAU V. HALLDORF.</h4>
        <p class="frau speech">She will surely enter it there, then. Come quickly, my
        dear children, so that it will look quite accidental. Here is your
        money.</p>
        <p class="direction">[_She throws a coin to_ ROSA _and unwraps a small package done up
        in tissue-paper, which she has brought with her_.]</p>
        <p class="frau speech">Here is a bouquet for
        you--and here's one for you. You are to present these to the princess.</p>
