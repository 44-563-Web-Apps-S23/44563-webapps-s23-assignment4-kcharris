        <h2>THE FAR-AWAY PRINCESS
            BY
            HERMANN SUDERMANN</h2>
        <p><pre>
            <h4>STRÜBEL.</h4> There, ladies! We have now rescued the useful instrument to
which the far-sightedness of mankind is indebted.

<h4>FRAU V. HALLDORF.</h4> <p>Thanks, so much. Pardon me, sir, but have you heard
anything about the report that the princess is going to make the journey
up here to-day?</p>

<h4>STRÜBEL.</h4> <p>The princess? The princess of the Springs? The princess of the
lonely villa? The princess who is expected at the iron spring every
morning, but who has never been seen by a living soul? Why, I am
enormously interested. You wouldn't believe how much interested I am!</p>

<h4>LIDDY.</h4> <p><p>[_Who has looked out, back._]</p> There--there--there--it is!</p>

<h4>FRAU V. HALLDORF.</h4> <p>The carriage?</p>

<h4>LIDDY.</h4> <p>It's reached the top already. It is stopping over there at the
edge of the woods.</p>

<h4>FRAU V. HALLDORF.</h4> <p>She will surely enter it there, then. Come quickly, my
dear children, so that it will look quite accidental. Here is your
money. <p>[_She throws a coin to_ ROSA _and unwraps a small package done up
in tissue-paper, which she has brought with her_.]</p> Here is a bouquet for
you--and here's one for you. You are to present these to the princess.</p>
